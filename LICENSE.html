  creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in
  unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each

<h2 id="4-restrictions-the-license-granted-in-section-3-above-is-expressly">4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly</h2>
<p>  made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p>
<pre><code>  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
  terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
  Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
  Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
  impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
  License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
  the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
  License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
  notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
  warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
  Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
  not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
  restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
  exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
  the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated
  in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
  from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
  License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor
  You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
  any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You
  create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
  the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
  required by Section 4(d), as requested.

  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under:
  (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this
  License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a
  Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later
  license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
  License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US)
  (&quot;Applicable License&quot;). You must include a copy of, or the URI,
  for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
  Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
  terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
  License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to
  exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
  the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
  refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
  warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
  Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute
  or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any
  effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict
  the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise
  the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
  Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
  incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
  Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
  the terms of the Applicable License.

  You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
  above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed
  toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The
  exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
  digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
  intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
  monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
  monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of
  copyrighted works.

  If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
  or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
  to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
  and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:

  Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by
  other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)
  the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
  practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
  associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
  copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)
  consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
  credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
  &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or
  &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The
  credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any
  reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
  Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if
  a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or
  Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
  at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
  authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
  required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
  manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
  License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
  connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
  Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of
  You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
  written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
  Attribution Parties.

  For the avoidance of doubt:

      Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
      jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
      any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
      the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
      royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
      this License;

      Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
      which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
      reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
      exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if
      Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is
      otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)
      and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through
      any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

      Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to
      collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
      the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
      administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
      from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
      License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
      noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
  otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
  Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
  part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
  mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
  the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor
  or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
  (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
  Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would
  be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other
  derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and
  reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate,
  this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
  national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
  under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but
  not otherwise.

<p>  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO
  THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE

  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF

<p>  APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
  LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
  EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
  EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<h2 id="7-termination">7. Termination</h2>
<pre><code>  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
  License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
  Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
  their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
  remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5,
  6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
  here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
  the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
  to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
  distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
  election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
  license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
  terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
  force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
</code></pre><h2 id="8-miscellaneous">8. Miscellaneous</h2>
<pre><code>  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
  Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
  Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
  You under this License.

  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
  Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
  the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
  this License.

  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
  of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
  action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
  reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
  valid and enforceable.

  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
  breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
  writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
  consent.

  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
  with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
  understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
  Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
  additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
  You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
  agreement of the Licensor and You.

  The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
  this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
  Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
  amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
  WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
  Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
  (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
  take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
  terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
  provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the
  applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted
  under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
  granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
  be included in the License; this License is not intended to
  restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
