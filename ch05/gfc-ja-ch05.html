<pre><code>¶1Consensus: Any group in agreement about something whose opinion is the same as yours; antonym of cabal [i.e., those who disagree with you]. — Wikispeak
合意：何かについて話者と意見を同じくするグループ。カバル（話者と意見が違う人たち）の対義語。 --Wikispeak
</code></pre><p>¶2H. G. Wells thought the “World Encyclopedia” should be more than an information repository, it should also be an institution of “adjustment and adjudication; a clearinghouse of misunderstandings.”1 Wikipedia certainly has its share of misunderstandings, some imported from the conflicted world it documents and some unique to its own undertaking. An example of a contagious real-world conflict is the “Creation-Evolution Controversy,”2 discussed in chapter 3. Also, political and ethnic differences are often mirrored at Wikipedia, prompting the formation of a “Working Group on Ethnic and Cultural Edit Wars.”3 There are also plenty of local “misunderstandings,” such as whether every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer deserves its own article. I raised this dispute earlier to illustrate two opposing philosophies at Wikipedia: inclusionism and deletionism. This issue, and the proliferation of articles, gave rise to an even more trivial — though no less bellicose — debate: If every television show episode has its own article, how should these articles be named so as not to conflict with other articles? This discussion reveals possible misunderstandings about consensus, and the difficulties of this decision-making practice in an open community.</p>
<p>「世界百科事典」は情報の保管庫以上のもの、「調整と裁定」の組織、「誤解の交換所」にもなるべきだと H. G. ウェルズは考えた。ウィキペディアにも相応のさまざまな誤解があり、そのなかには衝突する世界から持ち込まれたものと、それ自身の事業固有のものとがある。実世界から感染した衝突の例のひとつに、3章で議論した「創造・進化論争」がある。政治的、民族的差異はしばしばウィキペディアにも反映され、「民族・文化の編集合戦についての作業部会」の結成を刺激した。Buffy the Vampire Slayer の各回が独立項目に値するかどうかなど、個別の「誤解」はさまざまだ。これまでにこの論争のことは、対立する2つのウィキペディアの哲学、包摂主義と削除主義を説明するためにとりあげた。この問題、および項目群の増殖は、さらに瑣末な — しかし同じくらい好戦的な — 論争をひきおこした：テレビ番組の回が独立項目になるなら、その項目群は他の項目と衝突しないように、どう名付けるべきか？ この議論は合意についてなされうる誤解、オープンコミュニティでの意思決定の難しさを明らかにする。</p>
<p>¶3 In this chapter, I identify the difficulties of consensus decision making, and its meaning and practice for collaboration at the English Wikipedia. I consider this relative to insights from literature about consensus in other communities, including Quakers and the collaborators who built the Internet and Web using “rough consensus and running code.”</p>
<p>本章では、合意による意思決定における困難と、英語版ウィキペディアでの共同作業におけるその意味と実践とを明らかにする。</p>
<p>§2The Case of Disambiguation</p>
<p>曖昧性解消の例</p>
<p>¶4In the history of the encyclopedia much has been made of the attempts to organize knowledge and how that dream was eventually superseded by simple alphabetical order.4 Wikipedia continued this trend by avoiding any formal organizational scheme and letting people simply name articles as seemed fitting; articles are then accessed via other pages, including user-created categories and search engines.5 But a problem soon emerged: what happens when article titles conflict? A page’s title must be unique because it is also part of the Web address of the page. (Computer scientists call this a “collision” and it became increasingly common as the number of Wikipedia articles increased.) For example, what should the “Buffy” article contain? Should it be about the fictional character, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or the related film, TV show, comics, or novels — and which season or episode, issue, or book? Plus, there have been a few notable real-life Buffys. How should Wikipedia distinguish between them all?</p>
<p>百科事典の歴史の多くは知識を整理する多数の試みと、それがいかにして単純なアルファベット順に置き換えられてきたかとからなっている。ウィキペディアもこの潮流に乗っており、形式的な整理スキームを避け、適すると思われる名前をただ単につけさせるようにした。項目はその後、他のページから、利用者が作るカテゴリや検索エンジンを通してアクセスされる。しかしやがて問題が生じた。複数の項目の表題がぶつかってしまったらどうするか？ ページの表題はページのウェブアドレスの一部であるため、固有でなければならない（コンピュータ科学者はこれを衝突 collision と呼び、ウィキペディアの項目数が増えるにつれ頻繁に見られるようになった）。たとえば、「Buffy」という項目には何を入れるべきか？ フィクションの登場人物としての Buffy the Vampire Slayer か、その関連映画作品か、TV番組か、コミックか、小説か、そしてどのシーズンのどの回か、第何巻か、どの本か？ さらに、現実世界の Buffy という著名人も何人かいる。ウィキペディアはこれらをどのように区別するべきか？</p>
<p>¶5 In the case of a collision Wikipedia will likely offer the reader a “disambiguation” link at the top of an article or a whole page with a list of links to more specific articles, or both. “Disambiguation in Wikipedia is the process of resolving conflicts in article titles that occur when a single title could be associated with more than one article. In other words, disambiguations are paths leading to different articles which could, in principle, have the same title.”6 The “Buffy” article is in fact a disambiguation page that includes links to articles about the Buffy the Vampire Slayer film and television series, unrelated musical albums, biographies, and an astronomical object outside the orbit of Neptune.7 Furthermore, dozens of naming conventions have emerged that specify how to disambiguate collisions by qualifying the name with a parenthetical suffix, such as “Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film).”</p>
<p>衝突があるとき、ウィキペディアは「曖昧性解消」のリンクを項目の上部におくか、またはページ全体ヲより具体的な項目へのリンクノ列挙とするか、その両方を行なって読者に提供することがおおい。「ウィキペディアにおける曖昧性解消は、項目の表題の衝突を解消するための手続きである。衝突は複数の項目がひとつの表題にむすびつけられうる場合におこる。いいかえれば、曖昧性解消は、原則として、同じ表題になりうる異なる項目への道筋である。」「Buffy」という項目は実際に曖昧性解消ページであり、Buffy the Vampire Slayer の映画、テレビシリーズ、無関係な音楽アルバム、伝記、冥王星の外にある天体についての項目が列挙されている。それだけでなく、「Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)」というように、括弧書きをあとにつけて曖昧性解消をするための何十もの命名の慣習が生まれてきた。</p>
<p>¶6 However, must these disambiguators be applied in every case for consistency’s sake, or just those for which there is already a preexisting article? Answering this question, and thousands of others like it, is an integral part of Wikipedia collaboration. As the “Consensus” policy states, consensus is “how editors work with others,” it is “Wikipedia’s fundamental model for editorial decision-making.” Wikipedians are supposed to discuss and reason together, making use of verifiable sources and assuming good faith. “Policies and guidelines document communal consensus rather than creating it”.8 However, in this case of disambiguation an interesting problem arose: there was disagreement as to whether there was consensus.</p>
<p>¶7 So then, what is consensus and how do you know you’ve reached it? This question eventually reached the Arbitration Committee: “a panel of experienced users that exists to impose binding solutions to Wikipedia disputes that neither communal discussion, administrators, nor mediation have been able to resolve”.9 Jimmy Wales created the committee in 2004 because of the growth of the community and the corresponding number of disputes he could no longer personally attend to. Wales appoints members annually “based on the results of advisory elections” to arbitrate specific conflicts; however, the “ArbCom” seems to be evolving toward what might be thought of as Wikipedia’s high court in definitively interpreting — and some say making — Wikipedia policy.10</p>
<p>¶8 Presently, an ArbCom decision is documented on a wiki page in which disputants make statements and marshal evidence for their case.11 These are followed by the ArbCom members’ “preliminary decision” (e.g., to take the case and issue temporary injunctions) and conclude with a final decision that enumerates important principles of Wikipedia policy, findings of facts, remedies, and enforcement actions. Wikipedian Yaksha introduced the disambiguation case as follows:</p>
<pre><code>¶9 This dispute is regarding whether articles for TV episodes which do not need to be disambiguated should have disambiguation. For example, Never Kill a Boy on the First Date (Buffy episode) has the disambiguation “(Buffy episode),” even though this disambiguation is not required. I believe we did reach consensus to follow the existing guideline of “disambiguate only when necessary.” The straw poll resulted in a supermajority (80%) support for “disambiguate only when necessary.” The discussion that followed supported this consensus. A detailed summary of the discussion, as well as four Request Move proposals all support the existence of this consensus. Given this, I (and others) begun to move articles which were inappropriately named.12
</code></pre><p>¶10 However, not everyone agreed with the application of the use-as-needed policy and attempted to reverse the moving (or renaming) of articles. Wikipedian Elonka was of a minority that felt specific “WikiProjects” (i.e., pages and editors focused on advancing specific topics, such as a television series) should be able to use disambiguating suffixes consistently across their topic, whether needed or not. Putting aside “unethical tactics” that had been employed in the dispute, this minority that favored consistent-suffixes felt that “WikiProjects can set reasonable guidelines of their own.” “As television episode articles have been added to Wikipedia, most series followed the [use as needed] system, but many others chose to use a ‘consistent suffix’ system.”</p>
<p>¶11 Furthermore, the very process of deciding whether specific WikiProjects (e.g., television) could consistently use suffixes was troubled. Elonka noted that there was a poll, but its wording was confusing and contested “with multiple editors rapidly changing the wording and structure of the poll while it was in process.” Furthermore, “calls for a cleanly-run poll were belittled as ‘stalling,’ ‘immature delay tactics,’ and the ‘whining’ of ‘sore losers’ engaging in ‘borderline trolling’ who should just, ‘Give the fuck up, you lost.’ ”13</p>
<p>¶12 Had there been consensus on the naming of television episodes? Before returning to the details of this case, it’s best to first review the meaning of consensus and its seminal role in the development of the Internet.</p>
<p>§3“Rough” Consensus</p>
<p>¶13The Wiktionary definitions for consensus speak of “general agreement,” “without active opposition to the proposed course of action.” A more scholarly source gives a similar definition: consensus is overwhelming agreement “which does not mean unanimity.”14 The encyclopedic article “Consensus Decision-Making” lists requirements of consensus that, if achieved, can also be considered benefits: inclusive (“as many stakeholders as possible”), participatory (“actively solicit the input and participation of all”), cooperative (“reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members”), egalitarian (“equal input” with the “opportunity to table, amend and veto or ‘block’ proposals”), and solution-oriented (“emphasize common agreement over differences”).15 This is not unlike the meetings of one of the better-known practitioners of consensus: the Quakers. Michael Sheeran, a Jesuit scholar, writes of the history and practice of Quaker consensus in Beyond Majority Rules: Voteless Decisions in the Religious Society of Friends. In his study Sheeran notes nine features of Quaker meetings and decision making.16 One of those characteristics, central to the Quaker spiritual experience, has no analog in Wikipedia: silent periods at the start of meetings and when conflict arises. The characteristic of “small meetings” sometimes holds in the Wikipedia context for issues local to an article or project, but not at the larger scale.17 The remaining seven characteristics roughly parallel Wikipedia norms: unanimity and a lack of voting (e.g., “voting is evil”); pausing when agreement cannot be reached; participation by all those with ideas on the subject; listening with an open mind; facilitators, but no “leaders”; egalitarianism; and a factual-focus.</p>
<p>¶14 Therefore, consensus certainly seems like an appropriate means for decision making in a community with egalitarian values and a culture of good faith. Furthermore, this form of decision making has been central to online collaboration since the Internet’s start. Yet, while consensus might seem simple enough in theory, it is rarely so in practice, as is evidenced by the 1,176 pages of The Consensus Building Handbook.18 The history and challenges of online consensus, particularly this question of who decides when one has it, can be seen in the development of technical standards at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
<p>¶15 Both of these institutions host technical working groups that develop standard specifications for Internet protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) and Web formats (e.g., HTML). They work primarily over mailing lists, though teleconferences and occasional face-to-face meetings are common. The IETF is one of the oldest existing collaborative institutions on the Internet — it can be said to have built the Internet. And the W3C, responsible for many Web technologies, might be thought of as an institutional fork resulting from, in part, frustration over the slow pace of work at the IETF. Much of this frustration was a result of trying to come to consensus over technical philosophical differences. One of the most contentious issues had to do with naming/identifying things on the Web — further evidence that naming things is not as easy as one might initially think. In this case the disagreement was about whether the string of characters one types into the address bar of a browser should be thought of as a stable identifier for that Web resource (i.e., URI) or just a locator (i.e., URL).19 (This distinction is confusing, might seem trivial to most, and has become less of an issue, but it was of great concern to those involved at the time.) And while the W3C, unlike the IETF, has a paying membership that helps support a full-time staff (to hopefully speed the work along) and has Tim Berners-Lee as director to lend coherence and direction to Web architecture, consensus decision making at the working group level was retained.20 The W3C process document states: “Consensus is a core value of W3C. To promote consensus, the W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or by others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the general public).”21 Ironically, as the W3C matured, it too would be characterized as overly slow because of growing bureaucracy and the difficulty of achieving consensus in large and interdependent groups. Furthermore, Berners-Lee’s leadership role, which was intended to mitigate these problems and lend architectural coherence to the emerging standards, was occasionally challenged as not in keeping with the consensus practice of the working groups.22 In turn, Jon Bosak, a “father” of XML, a data-markup and exchange format — and one of W3C’s most prominent successes — created an institutional fork for subsequent XML work. The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) jettisoned the ideas of appointing a director and consensus in favor of the parliamentary, and more clockwork-like, Robert’s Rules of Order.</p>
<p>¶16 In any case, it was at the IETF in 1992 that computer scientist David Clark characterized IETF collaboration: “We reject: kings, presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.”23 This “IETF Credo” would become one of the foundational aphorisms of collaborative culture on the Internet. Furthermore, this simple statement reflects the egalitarianism — and meritocracy — seen in previous chapters of this book. It also hints at a source of skepticism of some Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) developers toward Wikipedia since encyclopedic articles cannot be compiled and “run.” Returning to the question of whether 80 percent support for a Wikipedia policy constituted consensus, in the IETF Credo we also see the intriguing notion of “rough consensus” as documented in the IETF’s “Working Group Guidelines and Procedures”:</p>
<pre><code>¶17 IETF consensus does not require that all participants agree although this is, of course, preferred. In general, the dominant view of the working group shall prevail. (However, it must be noted that “dominance” is not to be determined on the basis of volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of agreement.) Consensus can be determined by a show of hands, humming, or any other means on which the WG agrees (by rough consensus, of course). Note that 51% of the working group does not qualify as “rough consensus” and 99% is better than rough. It is up to the Chair to determine if rough consensus has been reached.24
</code></pre><p>¶18 Yet, even 70 percent of a group, for example, as determined by a chair seems like a far cry from “general agreement without opposition” as described earlier. Indeed, to understand consensus one must consider a handful of issues including the character of the group, the constraints of time, the role of the facilitator, and group dynamics; all of which are made more difficult in the Wikipedia context. </p>
